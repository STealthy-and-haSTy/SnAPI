EventListener Class                                              *EventListener*
===================

Note that many of these events are triggered by the buffer underlying the view,
and thus the method is only called once, with the first view as the parameter.


*EventListener.on_new*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called when a new buffer is created.


*EventListener.on_new_async*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called when a new buffer is created. Runs in a separate thread, and does not
    block the application.


*EventListener.on_clone*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called when a view is cloned from an existing one.


*EventListener.on_clone_async*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called when a view is cloned from an existing one. Runs in a separate
    thread, and does not block the application.


*EventListener.on_load*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called when the file is finished loading.


*EventListener.on_load_async*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called when the file is finished loading. Runs in a separate thread, and
    does not block the application.


*EventListener.on_pre_close*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called when a view is about to be closed. The view will still be in the
    window at this point.


*EventListener.on_close*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called when a view is closed (note, there may still be other views into the
    same buffer).


*EventListener.on_pre_save*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called just before a view is saved.


*EventListener.on_pre_save_async*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called just before a view is saved. Runs in a separate thread, and does not
    block the application.


*EventListener.on_post_save*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called after a view has been saved.


*EventListener.on_post_save_async*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called after a view has been saved. Runs in a separate thread, and does not
    block the application.


*EventListener.on_modified*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called after changes have been made to a view.


*EventListener.on_modified_async*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called after changes have been made to a view. Runs in a separate thread,
    and does not block the application.


*EventListener.on_selection_modified*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called after the selection has been modified in a view.


*EventListener.on_selection_modified_async*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called after the selection has been modified in a view. Runs in a separate
    thread, and does not block the application.


*EventListener.on_activated*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called when a view gains input focus.


*EventListener.on_activated_async*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called when a view gains input focus. Runs in a separate thread, and does
    not block the application.


*EventListener.on_deactivated*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called when a view loses input focus.


*EventListener.on_deactivated_async*(view)
  Returns: None

    Called when a view loses input focus. Runs in a separate thread, and does
    not block the application.


*EventListener.on_hover*(view, point, hover_zone)
  Returns: None

    Called when the user's mouse hovers over a view for a short period.

    `point` is the closest point in the view to the mouse location. The mouse
    may not actually be located adjacent based on the value of `hover_zone`:

    * `sublime.HOVER_TEXT`: When the mouse is hovered over text.

    * `sublime.HOVER_GUTTER`: When the mouse is hovered over the gutter.

    * `sublime.HOVER_MARGIN`: When the mouse is hovered in whitespace to the
      right of a line.


*EventListener.on_query_context*(view, key, operator, operand, match_all)
  Returns: bool or None

    Called when determining to trigger a key binding with the given context
    `key`. If the plugin knows how to respond to the context, it should return
    either `True` of `False`. If the context is unknown, it should return
    `None`.

    `operator` is one of:

    * `sublime.OP_EQUAL`: Is the value of the context equal to the operand?

    * `sublime.OP_NOT_EQUAL`: Is the value of the context not equal to the
      operand?

    * `sublime.OP_REGEX_MATCH`: Does the value of the context match the regex
      given in operand?

    * `sublime.OP_NOT_REGEX_MATCH`: Does the value of the context not match the
      regex given in operand?

    * `sublime.OP_REGEX_CONTAINS`: Does the value of the context contain a
      substring matching the regex given in operand?

    * `sublime.OP_NOT_REGEX_CONTAINS`: Does the value of the context not contain
      a substring matching the regex given in operand?

    `match_all` should be used if the context relates to the selections: does
    every selection have to match (`match_all == True`), or is at least one
    matching enough (`match_all == False`)?


*EventListener.on_query_completions*(view, prefix, locations)
  Returns: list, tuple or None

    Called whenever completions are to be presented to the user. The `prefix` is
    a unicode string of the text to complete.

    `locations` is a list of |point|s. Since this method is called for all
    completions in every view no matter the syntax,
    `view.match_selector(point, relevant_scope)` should be called to determine
    if the point is relevant.

    The return value must be one of the following formats:

    * `None`: no completions are provided

        `return None`

    * A list of 2-element lists/tuples. The first element is a unicode string of
      the completion trigger, the second is the unicode replacement text.

        `return [["me1", "method1()"], ["me2", "method2()"]]`

      The trigger may contain a tab character (`\t`) followed by a hint to
      display in the right-hand side of the completion box.

        `return [`
        `    ["me1\tmethod", "method1()"],`
        `    ["me2\tmethod", "method2()"]`
        `]`

      The replacement text may contain dollar-numeric fields such as a snippet
      does, e.g. `$0`, `$1`.

        `return [`
        `    ["fn", "def ${1:name}($2) { $0 }"],`
        `    ["for", "for ($1; $2; $3) { $0 }"]`
        `]`

    * A 2-element tuple with the first element being the list format documented
      above, and the second element being bit flags from the following list:

        * `sublime.INHIBIT_WORD_COMPLETIONS`: prevent Sublime Text from showing
          completions based on the contents of the view

        * `sublime.INHIBIT_EXPLICIT_COMPLETIONS`: prevent Sublime Text from
          showing completions based on `.sublime-completions` files

        `return (`
        `    [`
        `        ["me1", "method1()"],`
        `        ["me2", "method2()"]`
        `    ],`
        `    sublime.INHIBIT_WORD_COMPLETIONS | `
        `    sublime.INHIBIT_EXPLICIT_COMPLETIONS)`
        `)`


*EventListener.on_text_command*(view, command_name, args)
  Returns: (str, dict)

    Called when a text command is issued. The listener may return a
    `(command, arguments)` tuple to rewrite the command, or `None` to run the
    command unmodified.


*EventListener.on_window_command*(window, command_name, args)
  Returns: (str, dict)

    Called when a window command is issued. The listener may return a
    `(command, arguments)` tuple to rewrite the command, or `None` to run the
    command unmodified.


*EventListener.on_post_text_command*(view, command_name, args)
  Returns: None

    Called after a text command has been executed.


*EventListener.on_post_window_command*(window, command_name, args)
  Returns: None

    Called after a window command has been executed.

ViewEventListener Class                                      *ViewEventListener*
=======================

A class that provides similar event handling to |EventListener|, but bound to a
specific view. Provides class method-based filtering to control what views
objects are created for.

The view is passed as a single parameter to the constructor. The default
implementation makes the view available via `self.view`.


Class Methods
-------------
*ViewEventListener.is_applicable*(settings)
  Returns: bool

    A `@classmethod` that receives a |Settings| object and should return a
    bool indicating if this class applies to a view with those settings


*ViewEventListener.applies_to_primary_view_only*()
  Returns: bool

    A `@classmethod` that should return a bool indicating if this class
    applies only to the primary view for a file. A view is considered primary
    if it is the only, or first, view into a file.


Methods
-------

*ViewEventListener.on_modified*()
  Returns: None

    Called after changes have been made to the view.


*ViewEventListener.on_modified_async*()
  Returns: None

    Called after changes have been made to the view. Runs in a separate thread,
    and does not block the application.


*ViewEventListener.on_selection_modified*()
  Returns: None

    Called after the selection has been modified in the view.


*ViewEventListener.on_selection_modified_async*()
  Returns: None

    Called after the selection has been modified in the view. Runs in a separate
    thread, and does not block the application.


*ViewEventListener.on_activated*()
  Returns: None

    Called when a view gains input focus.


*ViewEventListener.on_activated_async*()
  Returns: None

    Called when the view gains input focus. Runs in a separate thread, and does
    not block the application.


*ViewEventListener.on_deactivated*()
  Returns: None

    Called when the view loses input focus.


*ViewEventListener.on_deactivated_async*()
  Returns: None

    Called when the view loses input focus. Runs in a separate thread, and does
    not block the application.


*ViewEventListener.on_hover*(point, hover_zone)
  Returns: None

    Called when the user's mouse hovers over the view for a short period.

    point is the closest point in the view to the mouse location. The mouse may
    not actually be located adjacent based on the value of `hover_zone`:

    * `sublime.HOVER_TEXT`: When the mouse is hovered over text.

    * `sublime.HOVER_GUTTER`: When the mouse is hovered over the gutter.

    * `sublime.HOVER_MARGIN`: When the mouse is hovered in whitespace to the
      right of a line.


*ViewEventListener.on_query_context*(key, operator, operand, match_all)
  Returns: bool or None

    Called when determining to trigger a key binding with the given context
    `key`. If the plugin knows how to respond to the context, it should return
    either `True` of `False`. If the context is unknown, it should return
    `None`.

    operator is one of:

    * `sublime.OP_EQUAL`: Is the value of the context equal to the operand?

    * `sublime.OP_NOT_EQUAL`: Is the value of the context not equal to the
      operand?

    * `sublime.OP_REGEX_MATCH`: Does the value of the context match the regex
      given in operand?

    * `sublime.OP_NOT_REGEX_MATCH`: Does the value of the context not match the
      regex given in operand?

    * `sublime.OP_REGEX_CONTAINS`: Does the value of the context contain a
      substring matching the regex given in operand?

    * `sublime.OP_NOT_REGEX_CONTAINS`: Does the value of the context not contain
      a substring matching the regex given in operand?

    `match_all` should be used if the context relates to the selections: does
    every selection have to match (`match_all == True`), or is at least one
    matching enough (`match_all == False`)?


*ViewEventListener.on_query_completions*(prefix, locations)
  Returns: list, tuple or None

    Called whenever completions are to be presented to the user. The `prefix` is
    a unicode string of the text to complete.

    `locations` is a list of |point|s. Since this method is called for all
    completions no matter the syntax,
    `self.view.match_selector(point, relevant_scope)` should be called to
    determine if the point is relevant.

    The return value must be one of the following formats:

    * `None`: no completions are provided

      `return None`

    * A list of 2-element lists/tuples. The first element is a unicode string of
      the completion trigger, the second is the unicode replacement text.

      `return [["me1", "method1()"], ["me2", "method2()"]]`

      The trigger may contain a tab character (`\t`) followed by a hint to display
      in the right-hand side of the completion box.

      `return [`
      `    ["me1\tmethod", "method1()"],`
      `    ["me2\tmethod", "method2()"]`
      `]`

      The replacement text may contain dollar-numeric fields such as a snippet
      does, e.g. `$0`, `$1`.

      `return [`
      `    ["fn", "def ${1:name}($2) { $0 }"],`
      `    ["for", "for ($1; $2; $3) { $0 }"]`
      `]`

    * A 2-element tuple with the first element being the list format documented
      above, and the second element being bit flags from the following list:

      * `sublime.INHIBIT_WORD_COMPLETIONS`: prevent Sublime Text from showing
        completions based on the contents of the view

      * `sublime.INHIBIT_EXPLICIT_COMPLETIONS`: prevent Sublime Text from
        showing completions based on `.sublime-completions` files

        `return (`
        `    [`
        `        ["me1", "method1()"],`
        `        ["me2", "method2()"]`
        `    ],`
        `    sublime.INHIBIT_WORD_COMPLETIONS | `
        `    sublime.INHIBIT_EXPLICIT_COMPLETIONS`
        `)`
