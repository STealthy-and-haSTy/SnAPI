    Setting `modifying_only` to `True` (the default is `False`) will only return
    entries that modified the buffer.


*View.change_count*()

    line, left-aligned with the `region`.

  * `sublime.LAYOUT_BLOCK`: Display the phantom in space below the current
    line, left-aligned with the beginning of the line.

  `on_navigate` is an optional callback that should accept a single string
  parameter, that is the `href` attribute of the link clicked.

PhantomSet Class                                                    *PhantomSet*
================

A collection that manages Phantoms and the process of adding them, updating them
and removing them from the View.


Constructors
------------

*PhantomSet*(view, <key>)

  Creates a PhantomSet attached to a `view`. `key` is a string to group
  Phantoms together.


Methods
-------

*PhantomSet.update*(phantoms)
  Returns: None

    phantoms should be a list of phantoms.

    The `.region` attribute of each existing phantom in the set will be updated.
    New phantoms will be added to the view and phantoms not in `phantoms` list
    will be deleted.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Edit Class                                                                *Edit*
==========

Edit objects have no functions, they exist to group buffer modifications.

Edit objects are passed to |TextCommand|s, and can not be created by the user.
Using an invalid Edit object, or an Edit object from a different View, will
cause the functions that require them to fail.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Window Class                                                            *Window*
============


*Window.id*()
  Returns: int

    Returns a number that uniquely identifies this window.


*Window.new_file*()
  Returns: |View|

    Creates a new file. The returned view will be empty, and its `is_loaded()`
    method will return `True`.


*Window.open_file*(file_name, <flags>)
  Returns: |View|

    Opens the named file, and returns the corresponding view. If the file is
    already opened, it will be brought to the front. Note that as file loading
    is asynchronous, operations on the returned view won't be possible until its
    `is_loading()` method returns `False`.

    The optional `flags` parameter is a bitwise combination of:

    * `sublime.ENCODED_POSITION`: Indicates the file_name should be searched for
      a `:row` or `:row:col` suffix

    * `sublime.TRANSIENT`: Open the file as a preview only: it won't have a tab
      assigned it until modified


*Window.find_open_file*(file_name)

    Finds the named file in the list of open files, and returns the
    corresponding View, or `None` if no such file is open.

  Returns: None

    Runs the named |WindowCommand| with the (optional) given `args`. This method
    is able to run any sort of command, dispatching the command via input focus.

    panel should be listed in the panel switcher.
