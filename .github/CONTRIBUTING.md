### Contributing to SnAPI

Welcome and thanks for wanting to make contributions to SnAPI!

The issue tracker is for reporting bugs or for suggesting new features or
enhancements, but that doesn't mean we're not interested in your thoughts,
comments and questions on SnAPI.

You can get in touch via the following options:

 * Twitter: [@OdatNurd](https://twitter.com/OdatNurd)
 * Sublime Text Forum: [@OdatNurd](https://forum.sublimetext.com/users/odatnurd/activity)
 * [odatnurd.net](https://odatnurd.net)

Before filing a bug report or feature request, please first check the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/STealthy-and-haSTy/SnAPI/issues) to see if
what you're experiencing or requesting has already been reported. If so you can
weigh in on the existing issue with any additional details or information you
might have to help fix the problem or guide development.


### Filing a bug

When reporting a bug in SnAPI, please make sure that you outline not
only what you experienced but (if possible) a reproducible set of steps to
follow to cause the problem to occur. Being able to reproduce the problem is
the best way to ensure that it gets resolved as quickly as possible.

Since there are subtle behind the scenes differences between different versions
of Sublime Text, you should also indicate what build number of Sublime you're
running along with the operating system that you're running it under.

You should also mention the version of SnAPI that you're using, in
case the issue you're experiencing has already been fixed and is once again
rearing it's ugly head.


### Filing a feature request or enhancement

As with most of my packages, SnAPI started it's life as the reference tool I
wish I had to the Sublime documentation without having to leave the editor. As
good as it might be, there is always room for improvement! The original set of
features grew based on specific needs and is by no means meant to be all
encompassing. If you have an idea for something that could enhance existing
functionality or be added to make SnAPI even more useful, please let us know.

When filing a feature request try to provide a succinct description of what you
think the functionality should do. Depending on the feature you may also want
to provide a step by step list of the actions in Sublime/SnAPI that would lead
to your requested feature being used, but this is not neccesary.

We're commited to ensuring that SnAPI works for everyone regardless of the
operating system they're running on, so when requesting a feature you don't
need to specify the environment you're running everything in (but we won't get
mad if you do).
